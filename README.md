# Leaflet-Challenge
# Leaflet Earthquake Visualization Challenge

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

1. **Get Your Dataset**
   - The USGS provides earthquake data in various formats, updated every 5 minutes. Use the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) for this project.

2. **Import and Visualize the Data**
   - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
   - Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depths should appear darker in color.
   - **Hint**: The depth of the earthquake can be found as the third coordinate in each earthquake's data.

3. **Include Popups**
   - Add popups to the markers to provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

4. **Create a Legend**
   - Add a legend to your map to provide context for your data visualization.

### Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)

- This part is optional and does not earn extra points. If you choose to complete it, you will need to gather additional earthquake data and incorporate it into your map.
